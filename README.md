## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YashLoriya02/storage-management.git
cd storage-management
```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

```bash
# Frontend (Next.js)
cd client
npm i

# Backend (Express)
cd ../server
npm i
```

3. **Configure Environment Variables:**

Create `.env.local` for the client and `.env` for the server as shown below.

---

## Environment Variables Setup

### Frontend (`/client/.env.local`):

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:5000/api
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=appwrite-endpoint
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROJECT=your-appwrite-project-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_DATABASE=your-appwrite-database-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_FILES_COLLECTION=your-files-collection-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_BUCKET=your-appwrite-bucket-id

# Appwrite Server API Key (For server-side requests, expose cautiously)
NEXT_APPWRITE_KEY=your-appwrite-api-key
```

---

### Backend (`/server/.env`):

```env
MONGO_URI=your_mongo_uri
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here
EMAIL_FROM=your_email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_email_app_password_or_smtp_password
PORT=5000
```

---

4. **Run the Backend:**

```bash
cd server
npm run dev
```

5. **Run the Frontend:**

```bash
cd client
npm run dev
```

---

## Folder Structure (High-level)

```
storage-management/
â”œâ”€â”€ client/   (Next.js + Tailwind + ShadCN UI)
â””â”€â”€ server/   (Express + MongoDB)
```

---

## Security Notes

* OTP-based authentication
* File storage security via Appwrite with restricted bucket permissions
* MongoDB for access control and user management
* Role-based sharing to control read/write/delete/share access
